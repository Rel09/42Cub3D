## Overview

Welcome to my Raycasting project, powered by Codam MINILIBX! ðŸš€ This project brings the magic of raycasting to life using the Codam MINILIBX library. Written entirely in C, except for the MINILIBX library itself and GLFW for additional functionalities, this project is a journey into the captivating realm of computer graphics.

## What I've Learned

Throughout this remarkable journey, I've immersed myself in the intricacies of raycasting mathematics, learning how to simulate 3D environments in a 2D world. From casting rays to rendering walls and textures, this project has been an incredible learning experience.

## A Solo Endeavor

While this project is typically a collaborative effort, I took on the challenge alone, pushing my limits and honing my skills. I'm immensely proud to present this raycasting project, showcasing not only my technical abilities but also my dedication to creating something beautiful and immersive.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you have a MAC, since this is made to only works on MAC :)
2. Clone the repository:
3. Compile the code: `make run`

Feel free to explore the code, try it out, and immerse yourself in the world of raycasting. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!
